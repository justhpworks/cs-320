# cs-320

To ensure my code is functional and secure, I included JUnit testing, double-checked my work, and cross-referenced it with other parts of this project and past ones. I also followed secure coding practices like input validation and exception handling.

User needs were explicitly gathered through the requirements outlined in the rubric for this project. In other cases, I would communicate with stakeholders, gather user stories, or ask for more information to clarify any ambiguities and ensure the software aligns with user expectations.

For designing software, I broke down problems into manageable components, applied object-oriented principles, and ensured scalability and maintainability.
